description: "End-to-end brand identity for a South Kalimantan pet store — brand guidelines, visual elements, original mascot design, and a website that captures the warmth and wonder of animal companionship."

### The Context

Himajin is a pet store rooted in South Kalimantan with a clear personality from day one: they sell cute animals, and they want everything around that experience to feel equally delightful. From betta fish to ball pythons, their inventory covers a range that surprises most people — and their brand needed to match the warmth and wonder that comes from being around small creatures you didn't know you needed in your life.

This wasn't a project asking for a generic retail identity. Himajin wanted something that felt as alive as the animals on their shelves.

### The Brief

End-to-end brand build: guidelines, visual elements, a mascot, and a website. Every piece of the identity had to carry the same energy — warm, fun, approachable, and unmistakably Himajin.

The mascot was the most distinctive element of the brief. Not every brand needs a character. Himajin absolutely did — because the heart of what they sell isn't product, it's companionship. A mascot could carry that idea in a way that a logo alone never could.

### The Challenge

Designing a brand around cuteness is both easier and harder than it sounds. Easier because the creative territory is rich and inviting. Harder because "cute" is the most subjective word in any brief — what reads as charming to one person reads as childish to another.

Himajin serves a real range of customers: families buying their first goldfish, serious reptile keepers, impulse shoppers who stop because something in the window catches their eye. The brand needed to be cute enough to draw people in, but grounded enough to feel trustworthy as a business.

The mascot design carried the highest stakes. A character that missed — too generic, too babyish, too disconnected from the actual animals Himajin sells — would undermine the entire identity. A character that landed would become the face of the brand in every context from social media to packaging.

### The Process

We started by spending time understanding Himajin's actual product range — because a pet store that sells reptiles alongside fish and small mammals has a surprisingly wide visual vocabulary to draw from. The animals themselves became a design reference: the patterns, colors, and textures of the creatures Himajin sells informed the palette and visual language of the brand.

**The mascot** was developed through multiple character directions — exploring different animal-inspired forms before landing on a character that felt original to Himajin, relatable to a broad customer base, and flexible enough to work across many contexts. The final character carries warmth and personality without being age-restricted — it's designed to be genuinely likeable to a seven-year-old and a thirty-five-year-old in the same moment.

**The visual system** was built around the mascot's world — a color palette drawn from nature and the vivid hues of tropical fish and exotic reptiles, paired with typographic choices that carried energy without sacrificing legibility. Every element was documented in the brand guidelines with usage rules clear enough to maintain consistency as the brand grows across physical and digital touchpoints.

**The website** was built to serve as Himajin's digital storefront — showcasing their animal categories, communicating their personality, and making it easy for customers to visit, inquire, or simply fall in love with something they see on the page.

### The Outcome

Himajin now has an identity as memorable as the animals they sell. The mascot anchors everything — it's the first thing people notice and the thing they remember after they've left. The brand guidelines give the team a clear system to work from as they grow, and the website puts that system to work digitally from day one.

More than anything, this project succeeded because Himajin's personality was genuine — and genuine personality is the best raw material a brand project can start with. Our job was simply to find the right visual form for what was already there.
