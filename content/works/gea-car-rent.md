### The Context

Most car rental brands communicate speed, prestige, or price. The visual language is predictable: bold typefaces, dynamic angles, imagery of cars cutting through open roads. It's a category that's well-worn.

GEA Car Rent didn't want to live there.

GEA's positioning was built around something more personal, more lasting: **comfort and warmth.** Not just the comfort of a clean, well-maintained vehicle — but the feeling of being taken care of. The sense that from the moment you book to the moment you arrive, someone genuinely has your back.

That's a specific emotional territory. And it needed a visual identity that could hold it.

### The Brief

One month to deliver a complete brand identity: logo, visual system, and brand guidelines. The brief was clear in its emotional direction — warmth, comfort, trust — and open in terms of form. No strict constraints on style, color, or type. Just an expectation that when a potential customer sees the brand for the first time, they feel welcome, not sold to.

That openness is both a gift and a responsibility.

### The Challenge

Designing warmth is harder than it sounds.

Warmth in a visual system isn't just a warm color palette. It's a decision that runs through every element — the weight of the typeface, the roundness of forms, the amount of whitespace, the personality behind the logo mark. Get one element wrong and the whole thing tilts — too corporate, too playful, too generic, or too cold.

The category also worked against us. Car rental visuals are so dominated by energy and dynamism that leaning into warmth risked reading as *slow* or *unserious* to someone who'd been conditioned by industry norms. The identity had to be warm without being soft, approachable without being casual, trustworthy without being stiff.

Thirty days meant there was no extended exploration phase. Decisions had to be grounded and fast.

### The Process

We started with a single question: *what does it feel like to be a GEA customer?*

The answer shaped everything. The journey of a GEA customer isn't transactional — it's relational. They're not just renting a vehicle. They're trusting someone with their time, their plans, their comfort. That trust had to be visible in the brand.

**The logo mark** was developed around forms that carry human weight — rounded, grounded, without sharp aggression. The letterforms were chosen and refined to project reliability while maintaining an approachable softness. Not playful, not corporate: somewhere in the middle, and deliberate about it.

**The color system** was built around warm neutrals anchored by a signature tone that communicates professionalism without distance. Every color in the palette was tested for how it reads across real touchpoints: on a vehicle livery, on a booking confirmation, on a phone screen in the back of a car.

**Typography** was paired to reflect the dual nature of the brand: a structured, readable primary face for clarity and trust, with a warmer secondary application for moments of direct communication — messages, taglines, customer-facing text.

The **brand guidelines** documented every element with usage rules precise enough that any future designer or vendor could apply the identity correctly — and feel the right instinct when in doubt.

### The Outcome

GEA Car Rent now has a visual identity that does what the brand promises: it makes people feel comfortable before they've even made a booking.

The guidelines ensure that warmth isn't a one-time design decision — it's a repeatable, consistent output regardless of the medium or the person applying it. Every touchpoint, from a WhatsApp confirmation to a vehicle livery, speaks with the same voice.

In a category that defaults to speed and prestige, GEA's identity is a deliberate alternative — and that distinctiveness is its own competitive advantage.
