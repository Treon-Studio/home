### The Context

A university runs on information. At any given moment, a student needs to know their schedule, their grades, or the status of an administrative request. A lecturer needs to see their class roster, submit marks, and track academic obligations. A staff member needs to manage data across departments without navigating five different systems to find one answer.

When these needs are served by disconnected tools — or worse, manual processes — the friction accumulates invisibly. Every small delay, every misplaced document, every "please contact the admin office" becomes a tax on the people trying to do the actual work of learning and teaching.

ULBI engaged us to build a centralized web dashboard that would serve all three user groups — students, lecturers, and staff — from a single, organized platform.

---

### The Brief

Design and develop a web-based dashboard system capable of handling the day-to-day operational needs of the university's three primary stakeholders. Each group has distinct needs, distinct data access, and a distinct way of working — yet all three needed to coexist within one coherent system.

The platform had to be accessible, clearly structured, and reliable enough to be trusted as the primary operational tool for an active campus environment.

### The Challenge

Multi-role systems are architecturally and UX-challenging in equal measure. The data a student needs to see is fundamentally different from the data a lecturer manages, which is fundamentally different from what a staff member administers. A single dashboard serving all three groups requires a role-based access system that is both airtight in its permissions and completely seamless in its experience — the right person should always see exactly what they need, never more, never less.

The academic environment added another layer of complexity. Universities operate on cycles — semester starts, enrollment periods, exam windows, grading deadlines — and the system needed to surface the right information at the right moment in the academic calendar, not just display static data on demand.

Designing for three distinct mental models — the student looking for their GPA, the lecturer managing class attendance, the staff member processing an administrative request — without building three effectively separate systems required deliberate information architecture from the start.

### The Process

We began with a role mapping exercise — spending time understanding what each user type actually needed to accomplish in their daily interactions with the system, rather than simply cataloguing all possible features.

From that mapping, three distinct dashboard experiences were designed within one unified system:

**The student dashboard** was built around the academic journey — current semester schedule, grade tracking, course history, and administrative status (library, fees, documents) all visible in one place. The information hierarchy was designed to surface what's time-sensitive first: upcoming exams, pending submissions, new announcements.

**The lecturer dashboard** was organized around teaching obligations — class rosters, attendance tracking, grading workflows, and academic calendar milestones. The goal was to make the administrative side of teaching as low-friction as possible so it didn't encroach on the actual work of educating.

**The staff dashboard** was built for administrative throughput — managing student data, processing requests, generating reports, and maintaining the operational records that keep the institution running. Data access was structured by department and role, with audit trails on actions that required accountability.

A unified notification and announcement system connected all three layers — ensuring that campus-wide communications reached every user group through the same channel, adapted to their context.

### The Outcome

ULBI's dashboard consolidated what was previously spread across multiple systems and manual processes into a single, navigable platform.

Students know where to look for their academic information. Lecturers spend less time on administrative overhead. Staff have a structured system for managing data and requests. And all three groups are operating from the same source of truth — which means fewer miscommunications, fewer lost records, and a campus that runs more smoothly as a result.
