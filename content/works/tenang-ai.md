description: "A 3-month brand transformation for a mental health platform — from existing platform audit to complete design guidelines and a high-fidelity B2B website prototype for enterprise audiences."

### The Context

Tenang is a mental health company built around accessibility — a chat-based platform that connects people with professional support in a way that feels approachable rather than clinical. Their core product speaks to individuals. But their next move was B2B: positioning Tenang as a mental wellness partner for companies that care about the psychological health of their workforce.

For that conversation to happen, the brand needed to show up differently. Not as a consumer app, but as a credible, trustworthy enterprise solution. The website needed to make a corporate decision-maker feel confident, not just moved.

That's a different kind of design problem.

---

### The Brief

Three months. The scope unfolded in phases:

- Audit and document the existing platform — understand what Tenang is, how it currently communicates, and what the design language already implies
- Build a brand and design guideline — a living document that defines how Tenang should look, feel, and speak across all touchpoints
- Design and prototype the revamped B2B website — a high-fidelity expression of the new brand direction, purpose-built for enterprise audiences

This wasn't a project where we could skip to the exciting part. The documentation phase wasn't preamble — it was foundation.

### The Challenge

Mental health as a brand category walks a difficult line. Too clinical, and it feels cold — the opposite of what the product promises. Too soft, and it loses credibility in the boardroom where B2B decisions are made. The brand had to sit comfortably in that tension: warm enough to be human, structured enough to be trusted.

The existing platform had been built product-first — with design decisions made in service of the consumer experience. Some of those decisions didn't translate cleanly to an enterprise context. Colors that felt calming in a chat interface could read as too light for a professional proposal. A conversational tone that worked for individuals needed recalibration when addressing HR directors and C-suite decision makers.

The documentation phase revealed all of this — which is precisely why it existed. You cannot build a design system for a brand you haven't fully understood yet.

### The Process

**Month 1 — Documentation & Audit.** We started by going deep into everything Tenang had already built. The existing platform was mapped systematically: every UI pattern, every color application, every typographic choice, every piece of copy. We weren't looking for what was wrong — we were looking for what was Tenang. The genuine brand signals buried inside the product that could be amplified and systematized.

From this audit, we produced a documentation of the existing design language — a clear-eyed record of where the brand stood before we touched it.

---

**Month 2 — Brand & Design Guidelines.** With the foundation documented, we built forward. The brand guidelines defined Tenang's visual and verbal identity with the B2B context in mind:

- **Color system** — the calming palette retained but extended with professional anchor tones that hold weight in enterprise contexts
- **Typography** — a dual-axis system: a humanist typeface for warmth, a structured secondary face for data, hierarchy, and credibility
- **Iconography & illustration style** — rules for visual language that feels distinctly Tenang without veering into consumer-app territory
- **Tone of voice** — written guidelines for how Tenang speaks to corporate audiences: empathetic but direct, evidence-informed, never patronizing

---

**Month 3 — B2B Website Prototype.** The guidelines were the blueprint. The prototype was the proof. We designed a high-fidelity prototype of Tenang's revamped B2B website — built to convert enterprise prospects: HR leaders, operations heads, company founders who are beginning to take employee mental wellness seriously.

The site architecture was built around the buyer's journey: awareness → understanding → trust → action. Every section earned its place.

---

### The Outcome

At the end of three months, Tenang had three assets they didn't have before — and each one built on the last.

The documentation gave the team a shared language for their existing design. The brand and design guidelines gave them rules they could apply consistently across every future touchpoint, with or without an agency. And the B2B prototype gave them a concrete, testable vision of their enterprise presence — ready to hand to a development team with confidence.

This project was a reminder that good design work isn't always about making something new. Sometimes the most valuable thing you can do is help a brand understand what they already are — and then show them, precisely, what they could become.
