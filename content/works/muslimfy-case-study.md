### The Origin

Muslimfy didn't come from a market analysis or a product opportunity deck. It came from a personal question that a lot of people quietly carry: *how do I actually stay consistent?*

Knowing what you should do as a practicing Muslim isn't usually the problem. Prayer times are fixed. The Quran is accessible. The knowledge is there. What's hard is the daily, unglamorous, untracked act of showing up — the Fajr you almost skipped, the dzikir that got displaced by a notification, the Quran session you meant to start but never quite began.

Consistency in worship and learning is a discipline problem, not an information problem. And discipline is something technology can genuinely support — if it's designed with honesty about what actually helps.

That's what Muslimfy is trying to be.

### The Vision

A companion for daily Muslim practice that helps users build and sustain consistency — not through guilt or gamification that feels hollow, but through gentle structure, honest tracking, and tools that meet people where they actually are.

Available across three platforms — **Chrome extension**, **web**, and **mobile app** — Muslimfy is designed to be present in the moments where Muslim practice actually happens: at a desk, on a phone, in the small gaps between everything else.

### The Challenge

Building a product for religious practice carries a responsibility that's different from building any other productivity tool. The stakes feel different. The user isn't just trying to complete a task — they're trying to live according to something they hold sacred. A product that trivializes that, or gamifies it in a way that feels disrespectful, or makes the user feel judged for missing a day — that product does more harm than good.

The core design challenge was finding the balance between **structure and grace.** Enough structure to actually help someone build a habit. Enough grace to not make them feel like failures when life — as it always does — gets in the way.

Multi-platform also meant multi-context. A Chrome extension lives in a browser, stealing attention from a productivity environment. A mobile app lives in a phone, competing with every other notification. A web app lives in a session a user has to intentionally open. Each context is different, and each version of Muslimfy had to earn its place within it.

Being open source added one more layer: the codebase had to be welcoming to contributors. Well-documented, cleanly structured, opinionated enough to be consistent but open enough to grow through community contribution.

### The Process

We built around one design philosophy from the start: **Muslimfy should feel like a friend reminding you, not a system auditing you.**

Every feature was filtered through that lens. Tracking is present, but it's shown as encouragement rather than a score. Missed days are acknowledged without penalty. Streaks are celebrated but not weaponized. The product makes room for the reality of human inconsistency — because that's exactly the kind of user it's trying to help.

The **Chrome extension** was built for the in-browser Muslim — prayer time reminders that don't interrupt, a quick dzikir counter accessible without leaving the current tab, and a small daily intention that appears at a new tab rather than demanding attention. Minimal footprint, maximum presence.

The **mobile app** was designed around the daily rhythm of worship — Fajr to Isya, with Quran reading sessions and dhikr tracking that integrate naturally into the day rather than demanding a dedicated "session." Morning and evening notification flows were designed carefully: present enough to be useful, quiet enough to be respected.

The **web platform** gave users a broader view — weekly and monthly consistency patterns, learning progress over time, and a space for longer-form engagement with content and tools.

Open source development meant that each component was built to be understood, not just used. Clean architecture, documented APIs, and a contribution guide that made it realistic for a developer encountering the project for the first time to actually get involved.

### The Outcome

Muslimfy is a product we're proud of not because of its technical complexity, but because of its intention.

Every design decision in Muslimfy was made in service of a simple goal: help someone be a little more consistent, a little more present, in the practice they care about. And as an open source project, every line of code is an invitation — to other Muslim developers, to contributors who share the vision, to a community that can make the product better than any single team could alone.

This is the kind of work that reminds us why we build things in the first place.
