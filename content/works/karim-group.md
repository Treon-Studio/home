description: "Deep WordPress customization and full on-page SEO for a Yogyakarta property developer — elevating brand presence and search visibility for Islamic-values residential communities."

### The Context

Karim Group is a Yogyakarta-based property developer with a clear identity: building residential communities rooted in Islamic values. Townhouses in strategic Sleman locations, interest-free payment schemes, and a commitment to creating living environments that go beyond the physical structure.

Their story was compelling. Their existing web presence wasn't telling it well enough.

---

### The Brief

The task was to take over and significantly elevate their main website — karimgroup.id. Not a rebuild from scratch, but something arguably more nuanced: deep customization of the existing WordPress theme, a refined visual style that matched the brand's character, full on-page SEO optimization, and custom pages built to convert visitors into inquiries.

The client knew what they wanted to communicate. Our job was to make sure the website communicated it — clearly, credibly, and to the right people searching for property in Yogyakarta.

### The Challenge

Working within an existing WordPress theme is a different kind of discipline than building from zero. The structure is already there. The habits of the previous implementation are baked in. Every customization had to be surgical — enhancing without breaking, extending without overriding the wrong layer.

The SEO challenge was equally precise. Property in Yogyakarta is a competitive local search space. Karim Group's positioning around Islamic-values living, strategic Sleman locations, and interest-free payment schemes were real differentiators — but they needed to be surfaced correctly in metadata, page structure, heading hierarchy, and content architecture for search engines to reward them.

The custom pages added a third dimension: each page needed to serve a business goal, not just exist as a content dump. Property pages, inquiry flows, location overviews — every page had a job to do.

---

### The Process

We started with a full audit: theme structure, existing content, current SEO performance, and what was and wasn't working in the site's conversion flow.

**Theme Customization** was done at the child theme level — safe, maintainable, and update-proof. Typography was refined to feel premium yet approachable, aligned with how Karim Group communicates. Color application, spacing, and section layouts were adjusted to give the site a more considered, confident visual presence.

**SEO Optimization** went layer by layer. Page titles and meta descriptions were rewritten with local search intent in mind — people searching for rumah di Jogja, perumahan Sleman, or hunian Islami. Header structures were corrected and content was reorganized so both users and crawlers could navigate the site with clarity. Internal linking was rebuilt to distribute page authority intentionally across the property portfolio.

**Custom Pages** were built for specific conversion goals — project landing pages for individual developments like Karim Residence Klidon, each with its own lead capture, location context, key features, and proof elements like testimonials.

---

### The Outcome

Karim Group now has a website that works as hard as their sales team.

The visual identity reads clearly: this is a developer that takes quality, values, and their buyer's trust seriously. The SEO improvements positioned key pages more competitively for local property searches in Yogyakarta and Sleman. And each custom page is built with a singular purpose — turning a visitor's curiosity into a conversation.

More than anything, this project was a reminder that working with an existing foundation is not a limitation. Done well, it's an opportunity to go deeper — to understand how a brand communicates, and to make every pixel serve that communication more faithfully.
