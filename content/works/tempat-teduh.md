### The Context

Banjarbaru sits in the heart of South Kalimantan — a growing city with real heat, both literal and urban. As the city develops, the need for spaces that offer genuine comfort becomes more acute.

Tempat Teduh — which translates simply to *shaded place* or *shelter* — is exactly what the name suggests: a space defined by its welcome. Friendliness, ease, and coolness are not just amenities here. They are the entire point. And what sets Tempat Teduh apart further is a specific promise: **proximity to public facilities.** The nearest essentials — medical, educational, commercial — aren't an afterthought. They're part of the offer.

A brand this rooted in place and feeling needed an identity that could hold that rootedness with warmth and clarity.

### The Brief

One month. The scope was broader than a pure brand project: logo design, visual identity, brand guidelines — and on top of that, a **base website** that brought the brand to life digitally from day one.

Four deliverables. Thirty days. Both the brand and the digital presence had to be ready simultaneously — meaning the website couldn't wait for the brand to be finished, and the brand couldn't be designed in isolation from how it would eventually live on screen.

---

### The Challenge

The word *teduh* carries specific sensory weight in Indonesian. It's the feeling of stepping under a large tree on a hot day. It's relief, quiet, coolness — not luxury, not grandeur, just the right kind of calm. Translating that into a visual system without it becoming either too literal (a tree logo) or too abstract required a careful hand.

Banjarbaru's context also mattered. This wasn't a Jakarta or Yogyakarta brand — it had to carry a regional character. Approachable to locals, credible to newcomers, and readable to anyone discovering it for the first time through the website.

The simultaneity of brand and web development compressed the decision-making timeline significantly. Every visual choice — color, type, spacing — had to be made with both the brand document and the screen in mind at the same time.

---

### The Process

**Brand Development.** We began with the core sensory idea: *what does teduh feel like, and how does it look?*

The answer lived in coolness and groundedness — not in bold contrast or dynamic energy. The visual identity was built around a palette drawn from shade and nature: deep greens, cool whites, soft earth tones that suggest both the outdoors and a trustworthy built environment. Nothing harsh, nothing loud.

The **logo mark** was developed to carry both warmth and structure — a form that reads as welcoming and legible at every scale, from a building sign to a mobile browser tab. The wordmark was set in a typeface with enough personality to feel human, and enough clarity to feel reliable.

**Tone and visual language** leaned into the three brand pillars directly: friendliness in the approachability of forms, ease in the openness of the layout system, and coolness in the restrained, breathing use of color and whitespace.

---

**Website Development.** With the brand language established, the base website was built to serve as the digital front door.

The site architecture was designed around what a first-time visitor needs to know: *what is this place, where is it, what's nearby, and how do I get there?* The proximity-to-public-facilities angle — one of Tempat Teduh's strongest practical selling points — was given intentional visibility. Maps integration, nearby landmark callouts, and accessibility information were built into the page structure, not added as an afterthought.

The visual execution stayed faithful to the brand: cool palette, generous whitespace, type that guides rather than shouts. On mobile, the experience remained calm and easy — no aggressive pop-ups, no cluttered layouts.

---

### The Outcome

In thirty days, Tempat Teduh went from a name and a concept to a brand with visual identity, guidelines, and a live digital presence.

The brand now communicates exactly what the place promises — before anyone has even visited. A first-time visitor to the website understands, within seconds, that this is a place that values their comfort, respects their time, and is genuinely close to everything they need.

The guidelines ensure that the brand stays consistent as Tempat Teduh grows — new signage, future marketing materials, social presence — all with a clear reference point.
