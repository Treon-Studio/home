### The Context

Bird New Media is a global video production studio with creative leadership and an international team that spans directors, writers, producers, cinematographers, animators, and drone videography specialists. They work with clients worldwide, producing content that requires both the technical discipline of a production house and the creative agility of a studio that operates across time zones and cultures.

A team like this doesn't struggle for capability. What they needed was a digital presence worthy of the work they put into the world — a website that communicated their global reach, creative confidence, and the breadth of what they can do, without getting in the way of the work itself.

### The Brief

Design, build, and deploy a landing page and portfolio site for Bird New Media. The site needed to serve as both a showcase and a business tool — a place where potential clients could experience Bird's creative output, understand the scope of their services, meet the team, and take the next step toward a project inquiry.

Next.js was the chosen framework — for its performance characteristics and the seamless rendering experience critical to a site built around high-quality video content. Deployment on Vercel ensured fast global load times consistent with the studio's international audience.

### The Challenge

Video-first websites are performance problems waiting to happen. The instinct to show everything — multiple showreels, full-resolution portfolio pieces, cinematic backgrounds — runs directly against the need for fast, responsive loading on any device in any country.

For a studio whose clients are international and whose portfolio is their primary proof of capability, a slow or broken video experience isn't just a technical issue. It's a brand statement. And it's the wrong one.

Beyond performance, the website had to solve a content structure challenge: Bird New Media does many things — narrative video, animation, drone work, remote production — and each service needed to be clearly communicated without the site feeling like a sprawling catalog. The user experience had to guide a potential client from curiosity to confidence in a single session.

The contact and inquiry flow was equally critical. A creative studio's website that generates project leads needs to make the first reach-out feel natural, not like filing a form.

### The Process

We built the site around a clear visitor journey: *see the work → understand the capability → trust the team → take action.*

**The hero** was built for immediate impact — a video showreel that loads fast, plays clean, and communicates Bird's creative range in under fifteen seconds. The technical approach to video handling was deliberate: external platform embedding (YouTube / Vimeo) for the heavy content, paired with carefully optimized preview assets on-site, so the page is fast on first load and rich once the visitor is engaged.

**The portfolio structure** was organized by service type — making it effortless for a client with a specific need (say, drone footage for a commercial campaign) to find directly relevant work without scrolling past irrelevant examples.

**The team section** was built to carry weight. For a global production studio, the network of professionals is a core part of the value proposition — and the website made that visible: directors, cinematographers, animators, producers — people with names and roles, not anonymous stock photos.

**The inquiry flow** was designed around the way creative projects actually begin — with a conversation, not a form. The CTA architecture guided visitors toward making contact at the moment they felt ready, with a submission experience that felt like reaching out to a studio, not filling out a government portal.

### The Outcome

Bird New Media's website now functions as both a creative showcase and an active business development tool. The visual weight of the work comes through without sacrificing performance. International clients encounter a site that loads fast, communicates clearly, and makes the first step toward collaboration feel obvious.

Built on Next.js and deployed on Vercel, the site scales globally — consistent load times regardless of where a potential client is viewing it, which matters for a studio whose next project could come from anywhere.

For a team that spends their days crafting how stories are told for other brands, having a website that tells their own story well is not a small thing.
